For compiling into a webpage, you need to run this in an R session:

```{r}
# Install the 'pak' package manager if you haven't already
install.packages("pak")
# Install 'r-shinylive' using 'pak'
pak::pak("posit-dev/r-shinylive")
```

And in your terminal:

```         
quarto add quarto-ext/shinylive
```
